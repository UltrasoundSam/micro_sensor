# Micro Sensor

This is a small repository to help me learn Embedded Rust with help of the [BBC micro:bit-v2](https://microbit.org/).

## Scope
At the minute, the scope of this project is to progressively add complexity in the following areas:

* How to write, build, flash and debug an embedded program in Rust.
* Read accelerometer and magnetometer data and send it to a host
* General microcontroller functionality (digital I/O)
